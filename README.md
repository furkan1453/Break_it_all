# Break_it_all
I am learning a little bit about OpenGL and this is a repository to put in practice my knowledge.
I am trying to create a simple brick breaking game.

You can build a Android version using Android Studio or a desktop version building it using CMake on Linux.

## Dependencies for Linux version
I am using the GLFW and mesa libs, so install it first.
```console
$ sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
```
